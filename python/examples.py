[05:05:20 AM] Hi, my name is Mike H. How may I help you?
[05:05:47 AM] Shirley Billson: Hi Mike  - how do I send to a list, but exclude some of the people in it (who are also on another list)?
[05:06:10 AM] Mike H: Do you have a way to identify the contacts you do not want to be included?
[05:06:28 AM] Shirley Billson: yes
[05:07:05 AM] Mike H: Is it another tag by chance?
[05:07:14 AM] Shirley Billson: yes
[05:07:36 AM] Shirley Billson: do you need the details?
[05:09:47 AM] Mike H: Not exactly.  Basically what you would do is search for the contacts you want to include then use one of the tag boxes on the contact search, set it to "doesn't contain" and select the tag you want to exclude.  It will only give results who do NOT have the tag of the other list.
[05:11:16 AM] Shirley Billson: I think I follow that...can you hold on while I try it?
[05:11:59 AM] Mike H: I am not sure if I can, I am slipping awaaaaaayyyyyy......
[05:12:03 AM] Mike H: Yes, go ahead.
[05:12:09 AM] Shirley Billson: actually, I'm confused...lol
[05:12:16 AM] Mike H: Haha, no problem.
[05:12:36 AM] Mike H: What is the criteria you are wanting to use to get the list of people not excluding the group?
[05:14:17 AM] Shirley Billson: I want to send to a group called blrtelesummit2014 (which may just be a search my VA saved) and exclude those tagged with 0400 purchases BLR upgrade
[05:17:14 AM] Mike H: Ok, so blrtelesummit2014 is a saved search?
[05:17:35 AM] Shirley Billson: yes, I think so...it must be, I keep using it!
[05:17:49 AM] Mike H: You select it from the drop down menu in the upper right?
[05:18:25 AM] Shirley Billson: I select it from broadcast recipients in the drop down on the upper left
[05:19:19 AM] Mike H: Ok, so you are doing this from the broadcast creator?
[05:19:31 AM] Shirley Billson: ok - penny dropped!  I get it....you can go and die quietly somewhere now...yes
[05:20:34 AM] Mike H: Haha, I wasn't dying, just slipping into the abyss of nothingness.
[05:20:52 AM] Mike H: Getting used to the overnight shift.
[05:21:00 AM] Shirley Billson: the abyss of nothingess is enlightenment!  Well done!
[05:21:32 AM] Mike H: Woot!
[05:21:41 AM] Mike H: I have a good sense of direction.
[05:22:03 AM] Shirley Billson: Thanks for your help...in the words of Arnie, I'll be back
[05:22:21 AM] Mike H: Haha, just as long as its not in a new Conan movie, that's ok.

[06:00:44 AM] Hi, my name is Daniel G.. How may I help you?
[06:04:32 AM] Smart Marketers: I had a sequence email sent out last tuesday with subject line "Stop banging your head", it had a timer in front of it email but there were 70 different broadcast reports created.

1. Why were so many different reports created?
2. Is there any way to combine those 70 reports?
[06:07:51 AM] Daniel G.: The system may schedule those broadcasts as contacts get added to that sequence at different times --- The system will try to batch as many together as possible, but it may send them out separately in some cases. There isn't really a way to specify how the system does this. As for combining the stats, there isn't a function that allows for aggregating those in particular --- It auto generates those "broadcasts" when it needs to send the email out.
[06:09:06 AM] Smart Marketers: Ok thanks for the insight

[06:31:45 AM] Shirley Zaccheo: ok
[06:37:37 AM] Sabrina M: Ok, so there are a number of things that could be causing this error.  One of them is that the email account that Infusionsoft is pulling the emails in from may not support a certain port or may not be configured with the SSL security certificate that is being used.
[06:38:25 AM] Shirley Zaccheo: ok, and how is that resolved - i will also bring it up to the owner and manager of the accounts
[06:40:18 AM] Sabrina M: Those two would both have to be checked in the settings of the email client that is originally receiving the emails.  I do know that we do recommend that users try to move away from this POP account feature and use the Gmail and Outlook syncs as POP accounts are a Legacy feature and we will eventually be moving away from Legacy.
[06:41:28 AM] Shirley Zaccheo: ok i will leave this chat up and show them that when they are available
[06:42:05 AM] Sabrina M: I can email you the chat transcript, if you like, because the chat will close after 10 minutes of inactivity.

[09:31:18 AM] Hi, my name is David K.. How may I help you?
[09:34:18 AM] Russell Dunn: Hi David, we are a new Infusionsoft user and are creating a file of contacts to import.  We want to include a tag that will segregate our current customers by frequency of service (i.e, BW for Bi-weekly, M for Monthly, W for Weekly, or 1T for one time customers.  If we add a column to the spreadsheet we will import with a column title of tags with those codes underneath for each customer will that allow us to use that when creating campaigns that will target different customers with different campaigns?
[09:34:47 AM] David K.: You are correct :)
[09:34:54 AM] David K.: Additionally under the tags column, if you have
[09:34:58 AM] David K.: Tag A, Tag B, Tag C
[09:35:13 AM] David K.: Each tag seperated by comma's like that will create a new tag (or add to the existing tag with the same name)
[09:38:46 AM] David K.: Was there anything else I could assist you with, Russell?
[09:40:39 AM] Russell Dunn: Just want to be sure I do this right.  So the column heading is Tag A?  Then in the column below for each customer under that tag I would enter BW or W as appropriate for each customer?
[09:41:09 AM] David K.: Nope, column heading would be Tags
[09:41:26 AM] David K.: Now within the contact row, under the column Tags will be Tag A
[09:41:36 AM] David K.: Then if you want to add more than 1 tag, you'll separate each tag by a comma
[09:42:45 AM] Russell Dunn: So then later in the campaign I will tell it what to do with Tag A?  So in essence Tag A = BW for example?
[09:43:03 AM] David K.: By BW do you mean a campaign?
[09:44:02 AM] David K.: You can use a tag goal to start contacts in a campaign.  Now campaigns aren't retroactive, so if contacts have the tag before the campaign is setup they will not be added to the capmaign.  You would need to manually add them
[09:46:32 AM] Russell Dunn: Sorry, still confused.  I have not set up any campaigns yet, just working on my contact import file.  But wanted to include tags in the import file that would allow me to then have different customers included in different campaigns based on tags in their profile.  Does that make sense?
[09:46:56 AM] David K.: Yep
[09:47:08 AM] David K.: So let me give you a couple guides to help me explain this to you
[09:47:14 AM] Russell Dunn: ok
[09:47:24 AM] David K.: http://ug.infusionsoft.com/article/AA-01087/0/Configure-a-tag-to-start-a-campaign.html
[09:47:34 AM] David K.: Now this is a guide on how to start a campaign when a specific tag is applied
[09:47:50 AM] David K.: Now this does not affect contacts that ALREADY have the tag.  If they just receive it then they'll be added to the campaign
[09:47:58 AM] David K.: If they already have the tag though, then they won't be affected
[09:48:10 AM] Russell Dunn: OK, I will take a look at that
[09:48:15 AM] David K.: Great
[09:48:29 AM] David K.: Now you can still add contacts that already have the tag to campaigns after you publish the campaigns
[09:48:33 AM] David K.: And here's a guide that explains how to do that

[11:42:11 AM] Hi, my name is Blake G.. How may I help you?
[11:42:15 AM] Test account Icloud.com: Sorry to be a pain, I really appreciate your help.

I have a campaign which has contacts throughout it. Somehow those first few who were about to go into my sales process have gone to no longer active and into historical bar one contact, despite having next steps all in ready mode. The main batch of people enter tomorrow and I really do not want them to go into historical like this.

Is this a issue that you know the answer for?

The campaign is called 'Email Sign Up Sequence' and the issue is between the first main sequence '11 free (transition) Lesson confidence' and the next sequence 'split test by name'. I see on the historical they are stuck on the 'split test by name' sequence and are no longer active.

Really appreciate any help.

Joseph
[11:45:37 AM] Blake G.: ok, i am looking at the campaign now.  so you are asking why the confirmation sequences show a historical number?  i am not sure i am following you exactly.
[11:47:21 AM] Test account Icloud.com: thank you. I have 5 people who entered the split test part, but only one moved into the next sequence, the other four went from active to no longer in there, I looked at the historical section on campaign and they are in there, but it is like they are no longer participating in the campaign having not gone into the next sequence
[11:50:16 AM] Blake G.: it is because out of those 5 contacts, only one of them had the A split test tag or the B split test tag.  the rest of them did not have either of those tags and your decision diamond is set to only push them to one of the next sequences if they have one of those tags.
[11:50:28 AM] Blake G.: https://josephclough.infusionsoft.com/Contact/manageContact.jsp?view=edit&ID=30 is the only contact of those 5 that has one of those tags
[11:52:17 AM] Test account Icloud.com: Hmmm not sure why they were not tagged to go down the ruled route. I must be missing something
[11:52:23 AM] Test account Icloud.com: thank you!
[11:53:04 AM] Blake G.: not a problem!  Glad to help out!
[11:53:40 AM] Test account Icloud.com: do you have any pointers as to why they missed the tag? Or should I just research online?
[11:54:47 AM] Blake G.: well i dont know why they dont have the tags.  when are they supposed to have one of those tags applied?
[11:55:11 AM] Test account Icloud.com: pretty much
[11:55:53 AM] Test account Icloud.com: okay. I guess I can force them through if need be until I find a solution on infusion
[11:58:07 AM] Blake G.: right, you can push them through to the next sequence, but they would need to have A split test tag, or B split test tag applied to their records before they get to that point in the campaign
[11:58:52 AM] Test account Icloud.com: I see. Okay, thank you..I better keep searching for a answer then
[11:59:35 AM] Blake G.: no problem!  If there is anything else we can do to help, feel free to contact s at any time!

[01:00:50 PM] James W.: Hey Jacob!
[01:01:02 PM] Jacob Hindhede: I am going to send out my first newsletter out one of these days.
[01:01:19 PM] Jacob Hindhede: I just want to sure I use the correct template
[01:02:00 PM] James W.: Sure!
[01:02:56 PM] Jacob Hindhede: One of the consultants from infusionsoft showed me - and helped build - the "Branded Email Template". Would that be a the correct template to use.
[01:04:17 PM] James W.: That honestly is a matter of opinion, if you feel it is the right template for the newsletter then go for it. You can always create templates based off of the branded one to customize it for the newsletter.
[01:04:19 PM] Jacob Hindhede: if lets say I have all the right text in the email and it looks perfect. Can you give some guidance on what to do from ther.
[01:04:38 PM] James W.: Yeah!
[01:04:50 PM] James W.: Did you want to send this out as a broadcast or campaign?
[01:05:50 PM] Jacob Hindhede: hmmm by campaign you mean a series of emails??? and broadcast is just a  single shot?
[01:07:22 PM] James W.: Campaign you can send just one as well but the contacts are continuously added. For instance if you did a broadcast you would set the list that you want to send to and it would send when you schedule it to that list. Let's say you had a campaign and you set the newsletter in a sequence that was waiting on the date of 10/03 to fire off, any contacts that get into that sequence will get that email up to the day it is set to fire.
[01:09:40 PM] Jacob Hindhede: Ok I understand. Then what I want to do is a broadcast.
[01:09:58 PM] James W.: Beautiful!
[01:10:14 PM] Jacob Hindhede: Hope so :)
[01:10:17 PM] James W.: So once you got the template ready you would go into marketing>broadcasts & emails>Send a broadcast.
[01:10:40 PM] Jacob Hindhede: ok. wait a sec. I'll have al look.
[01:10:52 PM] James W.: Sure let me know once you get there. = ]
[01:11:33 PM] Jacob Hindhede: Hep
[01:11:48 PM] Jacob Hindhede: Click "Create new"?
[01:12:11 PM] James W.: Yup click create new and then it will have a little list of contacts( just you for now) you want to click new search on the top left.
[01:12:27 PM] James W.: After you do that you can put in any criteria, name, email, tags, purchased products etc.
[01:12:38 PM] James W.: Let me know if you need assistance with setting that up.
[01:15:30 PM] Jacob Hindhede: Now I'm at "Who will recieve this email?" I'll would like to send it to all my contacts
[01:16:24 PM] James W.: Wonderful click new search on the top left and leave ALL search criteria blank and click search at the bottom that will pull them all.

[01:21:52 PM] Jacob Hindhede: when they buy they also regsiter email and contact info. BUT when we register the kids the customers who have kids always put in the mothers emailadress on the template. but that blurs our list a bit. Because if the family has three kids, the mom will recieve four newsletters from us. :(
[01:22:37 PM] James W.: Yes but!
[01:22:51 PM] James W.: Broadcasts double check for emails that are dups on the list and will skip them. = ]
[01:23:42 PM] Jacob Hindhede: also if the names are different on the forur adresses?
[01:24:03 PM] James W.: As long as the email address is the same it will skip regardless of contact name.
[01:25:30 PM] Jacob Hindhede: I would off couse like the mail to send to the mother and not to one of the kidst. How will the system know which of the three names to discard and which to choose
[01:25:56 PM] James W.: It usually goes off of whichever's contact ID is the lowest number.
[01:26:06 PM] Jacob Hindhede: ok
[01:26:19 PM] James W.: So that meaning which ever contact was created first.
[01:26:49 PM] Jacob Hindhede: So we should always ask the mother to register first and the kids after
