[05:05:20 AM] Hi, my name is Mike H. How may I help you?
[05:05:47 AM] Customer one: Hi Mike  - how do I send to a list, but exclude some of the people in it (who are also on another list)?
[05:06:10 AM] Mike H: Do you have a way to identify the contacts you do not want to be included?
[05:06:28 AM] Customer one: yes
[05:07:05 AM] Mike H: Is it another tag by chance?
[05:07:14 AM] Customer one: yes
[05:07:36 AM] Customer one: do you need the details?
[05:09:47 AM] Mike H: Not exactly.  Basically what you would do is search for the contacts you want to include then use one of the tag boxes on the contact search, set it to "doesn't contain" and select the tag you want to exclude.  It will only give results who do NOT have the tag of the other list.
[05:11:16 AM] Customer one: I think I follow that...can you hold on while I try it?
[05:11:59 AM] Mike H: I am not sure if I can, I am slipping awaaaaaayyyyyy......
[05:12:03 AM] Mike H: Yes, go ahead.
[05:12:09 AM] Customer one: actually, I'm confused...lol
[05:12:16 AM] Mike H: Haha, no problem.
[05:12:36 AM] Mike H: What is the criteria you are wanting to use to get the list of people not excluding the group?
[05:14:17 AM] Customer one: I want to send to a group called blrtelesummit2014 (which may just be a search my VA saved) and exclude those tagged with 0400 purchases BLR upgrade
[05:17:14 AM] Mike H: Ok, so blrtelesummit2014 is a saved search?
[05:17:35 AM] Customer one: yes, I think so...it must be, I keep using it!
[05:17:49 AM] Mike H: You select it from the drop down menu in the upper right?
[05:18:25 AM] Customer one: I select it from broadcast recipients in the drop down on the upper left
[05:19:19 AM] Mike H: Ok, so you are doing this from the broadcast creator?
[05:19:31 AM] Customer one: ok - penny dropped!  I get it....you can go and die quietly somewhere now...yes
[05:20:34 AM] Mike H: Haha, I wasn't dying, just slipping into the abyss of nothingness.
[05:20:52 AM] Mike H: Getting used to the overnight shift.
[05:21:00 AM] Customer one: the abyss of nothingess is enlightenment!  Well done!
[05:21:32 AM] Mike H: Woot!
[05:21:41 AM] Mike H: I have a good sense of direction.
[05:22:03 AM] Customer one: Thanks for your help...in the words of Arnie, I'll be back
[05:22:21 AM] Mike H: Haha, just as long as its not in a new Conan movie, that's ok.
[05:22:28 AM] Customer one: Enjoy your shift...pretend you are here in the UK having lunch.  Bye

[06:00:44 AM] Hi, my name is Daniel G.. How may I help you?
[06:04:32 AM] Customer two: I had a sequence email sent out last tuesday with subject line "Stop banging your head", it had a timer in front of it email but there were 70 different broadcast reports created.

1. Why were so many different reports created?
2. Is there any way to combine those 70 reports?
[06:07:51 AM] Daniel G.: The system may schedule those broadcasts as contacts get added to that sequence at different times --- The system will try to batch as many together as possible, but it may send them out separately in some cases. There isn't really a way to specify how the system does this. As for combining the stats, there isn't a function that allows for aggregating those in particular --- It auto generates those "broadcasts" when it needs to send the email out.
[06:09:06 AM] Customer two: Ok thanks for the insight

[06:29:07 AM] Hi, my name is Sabrina M. How may I help you?
[06:29:18 AM] Customer three: sorry i lost you for a minute
[06:29:24 AM] Sabrina M: No worries! :)
[06:30:23 AM] Sabrina M: Do you know if you recently changed the password on any of your accounts?
[06:30:38 AM] Customer three: no the password has never been changed
[06:31:15 AM] Customer three: and this is a fairly new setup but i can do all other functions and i sign on with that password
[06:31:39 AM] Sabrina M: Hmmm... ok, give me a moment while I test this out. :)
[06:31:45 AM] Customer three: ok
[06:37:37 AM] Sabrina M: Ok, so there are a number of things that could be causing this error.  One of them is that the email account that Infusionsoft is pulling the emails in from may not support a certain port or may not be configured with the SSL security certificate that is being used.
[06:38:25 AM] Customer three: ok, and how is that resolved - i will also bring it up to the owner and manager of the accounts
[06:40:18 AM] Sabrina M: Those two would both have to be checked in the settings of the email client that is originally receiving the emails.  I do know that we do recommend that users try to move away from this POP account feature and use the Gmail and Outlook syncs as POP accounts are a Legacy feature and we will eventually be moving away from Legacy.
[06:41:28 AM] Customer three: ok i will leave this chat up and show them that when they are available
[06:42:05 AM] Sabrina M: I can email you the chat transcript, if you like, because the chat will close after 10 minutes of inactivity.
[06:42:41 AM] Customer three: yes please, szaccheo@touchingclients.com
[06:42:58 AM] Sabrina M: Sure thing! :) Was there anything else I can help you with today?
[06:43:08 AM] Customer three: not right now thank you
[06:43:33 AM] Sabrina M: You're very welcome! Have a great day, Shirley! :)
