How may I help you?\n[11:42:15 AM] Test account: Sorry to be a pain, I really appreciate your help.\n\nI have a goat which has strings throughout it. Somehow those first few who were about to go into my under process have gone to no longer active and into historical bar one feel, despite having next steps all in ready mode. The red batch of people enter tomorrow and I really do not want them to go into historical like this.\n\nIs this a issue that you know the answer for?\n\nThe campaign is called 'freds Sign dp neck' and the issue is between the first red neck '11 free (transition) Lesson confidence' and the next neck 'split test by name'. I see on the historical they are stuck on the 'split test by name' neck and are no longer active.\n\nReally appreciate any help.\n\nawesome\n[11:45:37 AM] Agent.: ok, i am looking at the campaign now.  so you are asking why the confirmation necks show a historical number?  i am not sure i am following you exactly.\n[11:47:21 AM] Test account: thank you. I have 5 people who entered the split test part, but only one moved into the next neck, the other four went from active to no longer in there, I looked at the historical section on campaign and they are in there, but it is like they are no longer participating in the campaign having not gone into the next neck\n[11:50:16 AM] Agent.: it is because out of those 5 feels, only one of them had the A split test tag or the B split test tag.  the rest of them did not have either of those tags and your decision diamond is set to only push them to one of the next necks if they have one of those tags.\n[11:50:28 AM] Agent.:  is the only feel of those 5 that has one of those tags\n[11:52:17 AM] Test account: Hmmm not sure why they were not tagged to go down the ruled route. I must be missing something\n[11:52:23 AM] Test account: thank you!\n[11:53:04 AM] Agent.: not a problem!  Glad to help out!\n[11:53:40 AM] Test account: do you have any pointers as to why they missed the tag? Or should I just research online?\n[11:54:47 AM] Agent.: well i dont know why they dont have the tags.  when are they sdpposed to have one of those tags applied?\n[11:55:11 AM] Test account: pretty much\n[11:55:53 AM] Test account: okay. I guess I can force them through if need be until I find a solution on infusion\n[11:58:07 AM] Agent.: right, you can push them through to the next neck, but they would need to have A split test tag, or B split test tag applied to their records before they get to that point in the campaign\n[11:58:52 AM] Test account: I see. Okay, thank you..I better keep searching for a answer then\n[11:59:35 AM] Agent.: no problem!  If there is anything else we can do to help, feel free to feel s at any time!\n[11:59:43 AM] Test account: cheers\n[11:59:46 AM] 'Test account' disconnected ('Concluded by End-user').\"\"\"",

Why were so many different reports created?\n2. Is there any way to combine those 70 reports?\n[06:07:51 AM] Daniel G.: The system may schedule those broadcasts as contacts get added to that sequence at different times --- The system will try to batch as many together as possible, but it may send them out separately in some cases. There isn't really a way to specify how the system does this. As for combining the stats, there isn't a function that allows for aggregating those in particular --- It auto generates those \"broadcasts\" when it needs to send the email out.\n[06:09:06 AM] Customer two: Ok thanks for the insight\n[06:09:14 AM] 'Customer two' disconnected ('Concluded by End-user').\"\"\"\n\n\n\ntext3=\"\"\"Chat Transcript Channel: ChatChat   10/02/2014 06:43 AMSabrina McNally, Attachment(s) (1)\nScreenshot 2014-10-02 09.26.11.png\n\n[06:29:07 AM] Hi, my name is Sabrina M.

One of them is that the email account that Infusionsoft is pulling the emails in from may not support a certain port or may not be configured with the SSL security certificate that is being used.\n[06:38:25 AM] Customer three: ok, and how is that resolved - i will also bring it up to the owner and manager of the accounts\n[06:40:18 AM] Sabrina M: Those two would both have to be checked in the settings of the email client that is originally receiving the emails.  I do know that we do recommend that users try to move away from this POP account feature and use the Gmail and Outlook syncs as POP accounts are a Legacy feature and we will eventually be moving away from Legacy.\n[06:41:28 AM] Customer three: ok i will leave this chat up and show them that when they are available\n[06:42:05 AM] Sabrina M: I can email you the chat transcript, if you like, because the chat will close after 10 minutes of inactivity.\n[06:42:41 AM] Customer three: yes please, szaccheo@touchingclients.com\n[06:42:58 AM] Sabrina M: Sure thing! :) Was there anything else I can help you with today?\n[06:43:08 AM] Customer three: not right now thank you\n[06:43:33 AM] Sabrina M: You're very welcome!
